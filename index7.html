    During my internship in the Spacecraft Mechanical Engineering section at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I worked on the Separations team for the proposed Mars Sample Return mission. 
    These included designing a press-fit tool for cup-and-cone separation interfaces, creating ground support equipment for a torque multiplier, and developing an Excel-based mass-model sizing tool for the Developmental Test Model (DTM).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Press-Fit Tool Redesign:</strong> I designed a compact, modular press-fit tool capable of applying ~5000 lbf to push the cup-and-cone interface into place. 
    The design had to fit into tight spaces around already-assembled spacecraft components, maintain precise alignment to avoid damage, and include leak mitigation features to protect the spacecraft from contamination. 
    Adjustable threaded rods allowed the same tool to be used across multiple interfaces for insertion and, if necessary, removal. 
    I also built an Excel tool to analyze required press forces for different materials and interference tolerances, ensuring safe and effective operation.
    The press-fit tool was successfully greenlighted for further development, reducing the number of components by at least half and simplifying installation compared to the previous design.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Torque Multiplier Ground Support Equipment (GSE):</strong> I designed GSE to interface a torque multiplier with the Separation Nut, including creating engineering drawings and a 3D-printed prototype. 
    I focused on usability, testing the process of assembling, torquing, and eventually removing the tool using my prototype to ensure it could be safely and efficiently operated by ATLO engineers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Mass-Model Sizing Tool:</strong> I developed an Excel-based tool linked to CAD that automatically computes mass-model geometry for electrical boxes used in the Developmental Test Model (DTM). 
    Users input mass, key dimensions, and material properties, and the tool outputs CAD geometry ready for structural and vibration testing. 
    After onboarding the configuration engineer, the tool was adopted and praised for its efficiency.
