            As an intern within the Spacecraft Mechanical Engineering section at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I was working on the Separations team of the proposed Mars Sample Return mission.
            I worked primarily on developing a tool to impart about 5000 lbf to push a cup and cone interface into the respective structure through a press fit. The cup-cone interfaces define the separation plane as well as the load bearing surface and consequently the coordinate system during ATLO of the entire spacecraft. This requirement drives the extreme interference press fit.

            I improved on an existing press fit tool by designing a compact tool that can be adapted at each interface on the spacecraft. Since this tool will be used by engineers during ATLO, it was important to get their input.
            Moreover, the hydraulic tooling presents the risk of an oil leak close to the spacecraft. I presented my work with key stakeholders such as ATLO (Assembly Test and Launch Operations), CC (Contamination Control), and PP (Planetary Protection) to ensure the tool was practical, and did not pose serious concerns before developing it further.
            I also worked on GSE (ground support equipment) used to interface the torque multiplier to the Separation Nut. As this is another tool used during ATLO, I needed to ensure it could fit within tight spaces of the spacecraft structure and would be convinent for use by the engineers.
            Finally, I worked on an excel tool to be used for designing mass models of the spacecraft components, largely electrical boxes, to assemble the DTM (Developmental Test Model) used for structural and dynamic testing. The tool allows a user to input values of mass, key dimensions and material and automatically solves for the mass model dimensions. It is also linked to an updating CAD file.
