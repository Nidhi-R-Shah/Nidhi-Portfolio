            I enjoy exploring the intersection between art and engineering. I was lucky to be a Psyche Inspired Intern where I got to create 4 art pieces based off of NASA's Psyche Mission on its way to explore the metal asteroid 16 Psyche.
        <p>
            My first piece was a drawing of a chalkboard representing the first principles math and science that goes behind the complex space mission. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My second piece was an acrylic painting depicting a typical living room as if it were on board the spacecraft visiting the asteroid. This emphasizes the way every single person is part of the discovery, rather than just the scientists and engineers directly working on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            My third piece was colored pencil on a wooden panel showing spacecraft digging through to Earth's core, which is metal similar to 16 Psyche.
        </p>
        <p>
           My final piece was a card game with rules similar to Apples to Apples, created based on fantastical scenarios Psyche might encounter on its 6-year journey to the asteroid.
        </p> 
        <p>
            I also enjoy using my creative skills to represent the projects I am a part of. I designed the tshirts for the Columbia Space Initiative club, Columbia's largest engineering club. I also designed the mission patch for the 6U CubeSat, LIONESS, I am leading the design of.
