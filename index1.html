        <h1>L’SPACE Lunar Rover Design</h1>

        <p>
            During the Mission Concept Academy, my team designed a NASA Discovery Class mission by producing MCR, SRR, MDR, and PDR reports. 
            As the Lead Systems Engineer, I was in charge of leading all the engineering disciplines through our. 
            I utilized Notion to organize the team’s tasks, breaking them down and delegating to members. 
            I developed the mechanical subsystem, and much of the power and thermal subsystems. 
            We were given a budget of of 175 million USD and produced a culminating 140-page <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rPld5aanLc38dAyj1mtYznI5jVBcM1mf/view?usp=sharing">PDR</a>.
        </p>

            I was also in charge of the CAD; I used simplified designs for the COTS parts, and included accurate mass estimations. 
            Included above are the deployed and undeployed configurations of the rover. 
            One of the major challenges was maintaining within the 80kg mass budget, which was achieved using mass saving cutouts within the chassis and suspension design. 
            The undeployed design also takes into consideration the 1.5 m^3 volume constraint.
            As the lead systems engineer, I focused on integrating all the subsystems by creating the N^2 Chart and Block Diagram above.

            The rover is designed to prospect the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar south pole. 
            I developed the CONOPS using JMARS. An image of the mission location, path, and science sites I selected is also included above. 
            Additionally, I developed certain programmatics aspects including manufacturers, lead times, and testing plans. 
            These were all driven by requirements I derived from the mission constraints. 
            The team presented our final mission concept during a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11cPwFD8VRTnJ33BvH1dEMPdC6ep5t64T/view?usp=sharing">PDR design review</a>.
