        <p>
            As the mission lead for Columbia University's CubeSat program, I oversee both the 1U and 6U missions, managing all aspects of design, integration, testing, and cross-team coordination. Previously, I led the structure and thermal subteam for the 1U CubeSat, contributing to CAD models, prototyping the payload deployment mechanism, and performing thermal simulations and structural analyses to ensure the burn-wire system deployed safely within deployer and mission constraints.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The 1U CubeSat, fully approved for launch in April 2026, is designed to capture images of Earth from orbit while providing hands-on systems engineering experience. I coordinate collaboration across six universities using CalPoly’s PROVES CubeSat kit, organize meetings, track subsystem progress, and ensure smooth communication between teams. This includes managing documentation, testing schedules, and compliance with ISS deployment requirements such as strict mass and size limits, safe deployer interaction, and environmental constraints.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The 6U CubeSat presents additional technical challenges including tight pointing requirements for the optical payload, stringent thermal constraints for both payload and electronics, and complex operational phases where the satellite must slew to face Earth, sun, or target galaxies as required. I oversee CAD design, structural and thermal analysis, deployable mechanisms, and prototype integration, ensuring the team addresses these challenges collaboratively.
